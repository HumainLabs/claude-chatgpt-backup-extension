2. Click on "Add to Firefox" to install the extension
3. No additional configuration needed - the extension works immediately

### As a Temporary Add-on (for development/testing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before using the extension, make sure you:

1. **Are logged in** to your [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) account (for Claude backups)
2. **Are logged in** to your [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) account (for ChatGPT backups)

The extension uses your existing authenticated sessions to access the APIs, so it **cannot work** if you're not already logged in.

## üöÄ Usage

### Claude.ai Backup

1. Navigate to [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Click on the HumainLabs extension icon in your Firefox toolbar

   - "Backup Current Claude Chat" to save only the current conversation
   - "Backup All Claude Conversations" to save all your conversations

### ChatGPT Backup

1. Navigate to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and open a conversation
2. Click on the HumainLabs extension icon in your Firefox toolbar
3. Click on "Backup Current ChatGPT Chat" to save the current conversation

For both services, you'll be prompted to choose where to save the JSON file. The file will be named with the chat title and timestamp.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Is this an official extension from Anthropic or OpenAI?
No, this is an unofficial extension created by HumainLabs.ai. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Anthropic (Claude) or OpenAI (ChatGPT) in any way.

### Who can access my data?
Your conversations stay between you, your device, and the respective AI service providers. The extension only facilitates downloading your own data.

### I found a bug. Will you fix it?
If you find a bug that prevents the extension from performing its core backup functionality, please report it through our GitHub repository.
